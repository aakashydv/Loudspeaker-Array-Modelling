# Loudspeaker Modelling and Parameter estimation using Sparse based Optimization Algorithms
Project under **Prof. Rajesh M. Hegde, Dept of Electrical Engineering, IIT Kanpur**. Implemented **Plane Wave and Point Source
Models**, whose parameters were estimated using **Iteratively Reweighted Least Squares (IRLS), Matching Pursuit (MP) and 
Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO)** algorithms.
