# Modelling and Parameter Estimation of Loudspeakers and Ambisonic Systems using Sparse Based Optimization Algorithms
Summer Project under **Prof. Rajesh M. Hegde, Dept. of Electrical Engineering, IIT Kanpur**. Implemented **Plane Wave and Point Source
Models** for loudspeaker modelling whose parameters were evaluated using **Iteratively Reweighted Least Squares (IRLS), Matching Pursuit (MP) and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO)** algorithms. For **Ambisonic Systems, Encoder-Decoder** was implemented 
using **Matching Pursuit** algorithm.
